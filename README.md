# Life Insurance Policy Lapse Prediction

In this repo I develop a machine learning model to predict policy lapse in life insurance data.

#### Main Features

1. Modules

    - Tools.py: Contains useful functions for repetative tasks. Most notably, it has a synthetic data generation function.

2. Notebooks

    - 01_generate_life_data.ipynb - Contains the generation of synthetic data for the project.
    - 02_data_carpentry.ipynb - Contains the preparation of the data for analysis and modeling.

3. SQLite Database

    - The life_data.db file was created by the generate_life_data notebook.

        - tables:

            - life_data: 1 million rows of synthetic life insurance data.
